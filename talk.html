      <h2>VICTIM TRANSCRIPT</h2>
        <p>
         I need your help. I am not sure how it happened or what they did, but I got invited into a chatroom and I witnessed a video, a video that never happened, and they have been manipulating me with these videos and images. They know my address; they have all my information. They keep asking me to do things I donâ€™t want to do.</p>
        <p class="response-label">Your response :</p>
      <div class="response-buttons">
          <button onclick="positiveResponse()">Thank you for coming forward, it was such a big step.</button>
            <button onclick="negativeResponse()">You should have been careful about what you share online.</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<script>
    function positiveResponse() {
        window.location.href = "positive-response.html";
    }

    function negativeResponse() {
        window.location.href = "mission-failed.html";
    }
